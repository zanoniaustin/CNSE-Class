## API Design Part 1

1. The API aspect that I thought was the most thought provoking was the talk about Uniform API. Previously I have never thought about changing how an id is stored within a database. My default was what most people would think would be just a unique number, but I really liked how it can be still unique and help in not needing to manipulate anything from a url to get/search for that unique number since that url is being stored.
2. I know this was just brought up last class, but how do you handle when connecting multiple APIs and the different teams don't have the same goals in mind?
