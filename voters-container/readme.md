## Voter API

This is a demo application showing many aspects of how to use the Golang Gin
framework to create an API.

It keeps `voter` items in memory. For example you can load the database, query by item,
and so on.

To see everything you can do you can just run `make` and get help.  See below.  Also notice that some of the make targets take parameters.  To do this you add a key=value on the `make` command line.  For example, to get a `todo` with an id of `2`. you run `make id=2 get-by-id`

```
âžœ  todo-api git:(main) make
Usage make <TARGET>

  Targets:
           build                        Build the voter executable
           run                          Run the voter program from code
           run-bin                      Run the voter executable
           load-db                      Add sample data via curl
           get-by-id                    Get a voter by id pass id=<id> on command line
           get-all                      Get all voters
           update-2                     Update record 2, pass a new title in using title=<title> on command line
           delete-all                   Delete all voters
           delete-by-id                 Delete a voter by id pass id=<id> on command line
           get-v2                       Get all voters by done status pass done=<true|false> on command line
           get-v2-all                   Get all voters using version 2
```

### Why use the gin framework?

Many people in the golang community are opposed to using frameworks because the standard library provides robust function out-of-the-box.  However, the golang gin framework reduces a lot of the code you need to write and has a lot of nice features out of the box.  As far as I know its still the most popular and widely used API framework for go.
